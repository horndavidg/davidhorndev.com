<p class="help-block description">
<i class="fa fa-usd"></i>tash is an app built around a simple premise, saving money should be fun and you shouldnâ€™t have to do it alone. Users can add non-necessities that they spend money on daily and then when they skip that purchase, go into the app and register it with a simple click. <i class="fa fa-usd"></i>tash keeps track of your most recent saves and graphs out your most popular categories by percentage. You can also see how the community as a whole is doing and who has saved what via an updating feed. Finally, there is a built in reward system so the more you save, the more badges you earn. <i class="fa fa-usd"></i>tash was developed with AngularJS and has a Ruby on Rails API with D3 Charts, Uploadcare API for user photos, and Mandrill for mailers.

<p class="help-block description">Local Me is an event scheduling application that can be tailored to a single city for specificity. I developed this app with a classmate and we used Ruby on Rails with Google OAuth, added functionality for posting to Google Calendar as well as picture uploading, and a combination of jQuery with AJAX for single page functionality.</p>

<div class="text-center"><i class="fa fa-suitcase project-icon"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://rapturecapture.herokuapp.com" class="project" target="_blank">Rapture Capture</a>
<p class="help-block description">Rapture Capture is a travel journaling application that I developed using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. People can create accounts and start to save their memories from favorite trips by adding the locations to a personalized map (using Google Map API), uploading photos from the trip (using Uploadcare) and saving specific journal entries to specific days on a given trip. Also allows users to see current weather information and other location specific information. Finally incorporated jQuery and AJAX for single page functionality.</p>
